Installing vFile32 Version 1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1>Unzip the zip file using Winzip (with the Use Folder Names checkbox filtered)
2>Locate the MemHlp.cpp and Memhlp.def files and compile it into a DLL using your C++ compiler 
	OR
    Locate the Memhlp.dlb file and rename it as Memhlp.dll
3>Copy Memhlp.dll to your c:\windows\system (Win9x /me) or System32 (WinNT/2K/XP) folder
4>Then compile the VFile32.vbp and place the DLL in say C:\YourFolder
5>Open Demo.vbp and try to compile it... Most probably VB will complain about a missing reference...
    VB will then pop up the references box... Unselect the MISSING:Virtual File ..... component and select 
    browse. Locate VFile32.dll in C:\YourFolder and click OK...
6>Now compile the demo and run two (or more) instances of it !

That's it !
